#+title: Yomichan settings

This is my current configuration for yomichan cobbled together from various
places. The settings are exported as [[file:yomichan.json]]. You can import them
from =Yomichan Settings -> Backup -> Import settings=. Yomichan will complain
about field templates being non-standard but that's okay, it only has some
handlebars from Aquafina's JP Mining Note.

* Setup Notes

** Dicts

You can find the dictionaries I currently use under [[file:dicts/][yomichan/dicts]]. You
can find the originals by following the references if you care to.

*** Language

I currently use only bilingual dicts. Updated [[https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/jmdict-english-yomichan][JMDict from Aquafina]] and a couple
of dictionaries from Shoui of TMW.

*** Frequency

Only using JPDB and CC100 for now.

*** Grammar

Only DoJG for now.

*** Kanji

Only KanjiDic for now. I actually didn't like having more than one of these
around because it was just noise but you could limit the results differently if
you wanted.

Not using any Kanji Frequence dicts for now. I figure I don't really care about
Kanji for now and only care about vocab so will just pick up the kanji if the
vocab requires it.

*** Pitch Accent

Just using the recommended dict from TMW. I didn't like having multiple ones of
these around either.

** General

I have Yomichan sort results based on CC100.

** Scanning

I enable scanning on hover without a hotkey to hold down. You can just disable
scanning altogether with =Alt + Delete= when you don't want to be looking up
stuff anyway.

** Audio

I add two additional sources which both require corresponding Anki plugins to
have been setup appropriately.

*** Local Forvo Server

Anki add-on ID =580654285=.

Just to find more audio if default Yomichan sources are missing them.

*** Local Audio Server

Just forked as-is from [[https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle/local-audio-yomichan][here]]. You have to add the add-on manually to Anki by
installing from file.

Although this is intended for offline use, for me this is really just so
yomichan can find more audio. I am not sure if it's just because my PC is old
or what but fetching results from online is faster than fetching results from
this so I still have the default JapanesePod101 as the first source.

** Translation

I add some custom translations that aren't in dicts like duplicate kanji (i.e.,
=ã€…=) or numerals to their kanji forms because some people throw in numerals
instead of kanji for words that have numbers.

=Settings -> Translation -> Custom Text Replacement Patterns= if you want to
play around with it yourself.

** Anki

*** AnkiConnect

Duh. Have to enable this if you are even remotely serious about learning JP. I
just use the defaults for everything.

*** Anki Card Format

Straight up just setting up [[https://aquafina-water-bottle.github.io/jp-mining-note/setupyomichan/][Aquafina's JP Mining Note]] which I more or less use
as is. I like click vocab cards the most from the various options so that's
what I have it creating by default.

I use a deck called =Mine= fwiw so you will need that deck created in Anki if
you want to use this as-is.

*** Anki Card Templates

Again, additional handlebar stuff from Aquafina that's required for the mining
note.
